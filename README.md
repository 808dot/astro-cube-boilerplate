# Astro CUBE CSS Boilerplate

Based on the [CUBE CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/Set-Creative-Studio/cube-boilerplate). 

There's value to Tailwind utility classes, and a structured CSS methodology. This project gives you the best of both. A starting point for a modern web project, using Astro, Utopia, Cube CSS, Every Layouts, and Tailwind CSS.

Uses:
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/)
- [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi/)
- [Every Layouts](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
